Hi everyone, I’m David, founder of Zap Pilot — the autopilot for your on-chain portfolio.

Managing your DeFi portfolio today is a mess. Rebalancing means bridging, swapping, unstaking, restaking — across multiple chains and protocols. It’s complicated, and it easily takes over 30 minutes just to rebalance once.

That’s why most users don’t do it — and end up losing yield.

Zap Pilot solves this with a 30-second, one-click optimization.
We help you sell the winners, buy the laggards, route your funds into higher-yielding pools — and even auto-sweep your dust rewards.

So what makes us different?

First, we batch your entire intent — including cross-chain swaps, unstaking, reallocating, and reward claiming — into one seamless transaction.

Then, we route everything across chains and protocols for you — in just one click.

And here’s the key: Zap Pilot doesn’t custody your funds. Ever.

We use EIP-7702 to temporarily upgrade your wallet, so it behaves like a smart contract wallet — but everything still runs from your own address, fully in your control.

It’s like turning your MetaMask into a Tesla — with autopilot mode for rebalancing.

We charge just a one-time 1% entry fee. All future rebalances are completely free.

Compared to competitors like Superform and Yo Protocol — which take custody through vaults or centralized strategies — Zap Pilot is 100% non-custodial. Your assets stay in your wallet, always.

We’re based in Taiwan, Japan, and Beijing, and backed by advisors from Microsoft and Skymania.

Thanks for listening — if you want to save time and earn more, we’d love to chat.
